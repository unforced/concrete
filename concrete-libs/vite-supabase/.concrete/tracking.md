# Project Tracking

This document tracks the progress of your project development using outcome-based milestones.

## Vision Alignment Score

| Area | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Feature Alignment | - | How well do current features support the vision? |
| Progress Pace | - | Are we moving at the right speed toward our vision? |
| Quality | - | Is the quality meeting our vision standards? |
| User Value | - | How much value are we delivering to users? |

*Update these scores regularly (at least monthly) to ensure continued alignment with your vision.*
