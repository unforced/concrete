# Guides

This folder contains step-by-step guides for implementing project milestones.

## How This Works

1. As your project develops, the AI assistant will help create guide files for each milestone
2. These guides will be numbered sequentially (e.g., `00-project-setup.md`, `01-feature-implementation.md`)
3. Each guide will include clear steps, user actions, and next steps

## Guide Template

Each guide should follow this consistent structure:

```markdown
# Guide [XX]: [Milestone Name]

## Vision Alignment
*How this milestone contributes to the overall project vision*

[Brief explanation of how completing this milestone moves the project closer to the vision]

## Outcome
*The measurable result this guide helps achieve*

By the end of this guide, you will have:
- [Specific, measurable outcome 1]
- [Specific, measurable outcome 2]
- [Specific, measurable outcome 3]

## Prerequisites
- [Prerequisite 1]
- [Prerequisite 2]
- [Prerequisite 3]

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: [First Major Step]
*Brief explanation of this step's purpose*

1. [Detailed instruction]
2. [Detailed instruction]
3. [Detailed instruction]

**Expected Result**: [What you should see when this step is complete]

### Step 2: [Second Major Step]
*Brief explanation of this step's purpose*

1. [Detailed instruction]
2. [Detailed instruction]
3. [Detailed instruction]

**Expected Result**: [What you should see when this step is complete]

## Verification
*How to confirm the milestone is complete*

- [ ] [Verification item 1]
- [ ] [Verification item 2]
- [ ] [Verification item 3]

## Next Steps
- [Next step 1]
- [Next step 2]
- [Next step 3]

## Troubleshooting
*Common issues and their solutions*

**Issue**: [Description of common problem]
**Solution**: [Steps to resolve]

**Issue**: [Description of common problem]
**Solution**: [Steps to resolve]
```

## Benefits of Structured Guides

- **Vision Alignment**: Each guide explicitly connects to the project vision
- **Outcome Focus**: Emphasis on measurable results rather than just activities
- **Clear Verification**: Specific criteria to confirm completion
- **Consistent Format**: Predictable structure makes guides easier to follow
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues addressed proactively

Guides will be created as needed based on your project's specific requirements and milestones. The AI assistant will help maintain this consistent structure while adapting the content to your project's unique needs.
