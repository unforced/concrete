# Ideation

This folder is where you can store your thoughts, ideas, and vision documents for your project.

## How to Use This Folder

1. Create markdown (.md) files in this folder to capture your ideas
2. Name files descriptively, e.g., `project-vision.md`, `feature-ideas.md`, etc.
3. Share these documents with the AI assistant by mentioning them in conversation

## Tips for Effective Ideation

- Be as detailed or as high-level as you like - the AI will ask clarifying questions
- Don't worry about structure or formatting - just focus on capturing your thoughts
- Feel free to include questions or areas where you're uncertain
- Update these documents as your ideas evolve

The AI assistant will read these documents and help you refine your ideas into a concrete project plan.
