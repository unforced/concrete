# Guide: Web Interface Development

This guide outlines the steps for developing the web interface for Concrete, which will allow users to create their concrete structure through a chatbot interface.

## Objectives

- Create a web-based interface for generating .concrete structures
- Implement a conversational AI chatbot to guide users through vision refinement
- Develop visualization tools to help users understand their project structure
- Enable multi-modal input methods for flexible ideation
- Provide export and integration options for seamless workflow
- Support collaborative features for team-based development

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Design Phase

- [ ] Create wireframes for the main interface components
- [ ] Design the chatbot conversation flow
- [ ] Develop user personas and journey maps
- [ ] Create visual design system (colors, typography, components)
- [ ] Design responsive layouts for different devices

### 2. Frontend Development

- [ ] Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
- [ ] Implement UI components based on design system
- [ ] Create chat interface with message history
- [ ] Develop visualization components for project structure
- [ ] Implement file upload and processing functionality
- [ ] Create export functionality for .concrete structures

### 3. Backend Development

- [ ] Set up Supabase project for data storage
- [ ] Create API endpoints for chatbot interactions
- [ ] Implement authentication system
- [ ] Develop file processing and analysis services
- [ ] Create .concrete structure generation logic
- [ ] Set up WebSockets for real-time collaboration

### 4. AI Integration

- [ ] Research and select appropriate LLM APIs
- [ ] Develop prompt engineering for effective conversations
- [ ] Create context management for ongoing discussions
- [ ] Implement feedback loops for improving AI responses
- [ ] Develop voice interface capabilities

### 5. Testing and Refinement

- [ ] Conduct usability testing with target users
- [ ] Gather feedback on chatbot effectiveness
- [ ] Test export and integration workflows
- [ ] Optimize performance and accessibility
- [ ] Refine UI/UX based on user feedback

### 6. Deployment

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Monitor performance and user engagement
- [ ] Implement analytics for usage tracking
- [ ] Create documentation for users

## Technical Considerations

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js or Python
- **Database**: Supabase
- **AI**: OpenAI API, Anthropic API
- **Real-time**: WebSockets
- **Deployment**: Vercel or similar

### Architecture

The application will follow a modern web architecture:

1. **Client Layer**: Next.js application with React components
2. **API Layer**: Serverless functions for backend logic
3. **Data Layer**: Supabase for storage and authentication
4. **AI Layer**: Integration with LLM APIs for conversation
5. **Export Layer**: Services for generating .concrete structures

### Security Considerations

- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Secure API endpoints and database access
- Handle user data according to privacy regulations
- Implement rate limiting for API calls
- Ensure secure file handling for uploads and exports
