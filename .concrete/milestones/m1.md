# Milestone 1: Project Setup & Core Structure  
*Status: Not Started*  
*Created: [Insert Date]*  
*Last Updated: [Insert Date]*  

## Goals  
We’re kicking things off by setting up the foundation of our project. This milestone gets our environment ready and lays the groundwork for coding. *Note: This is a placeholder—once we define our project, we’ll tweak this to fit its unique vibe.*  

## Tasks  
- [ ] Initialize git repository and commit initial `.concrete/` structure  
- [ ] Set up the tech stack (e.g., install dependencies, configure build tools)  
- [ ] Create basic file structure based on Technical Architecture from `system.md`  
- [ ] Draft initial data schema (if applicable) and drop it in `.concrete/ideation/data-sketch.md` for review  
- [ ] Build a “Hello World” page or feature to test the setup  
- [ ] Review with you: Does the setup feel right? Any tweaks before we move on?  

## Notes  
- We’ll use `.concrete/ideation` to brainstorm the data schema if it’s complex—let’s riff there first.  
- Mid-milestone commit: After the stack is set up and file structure is in place.  
- Final commit: After the “Hello World” is live and you’re happy with it.
