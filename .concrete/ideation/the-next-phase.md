The next phase of this project involves creating an interface on the web which enables people to create their concrete structure.
This will most likely take the form of a chatbot, ideally one which has an optional voice interface, that you can talk to about what you're wanting to create.
The chatbot should incorporate the concrete systems as we know them here, and should play the role of a creative partner who is helping you refine your vision.
It should be asking questions to clarify it's understanding and it should also be sharing what it understands about the vision to ensure it is seeing what the user is seeing.
While the chat interface is the primary interface, I'm open to ideas of what other ways a user might want to interface with this system, that support the ideation process.
The goal of this interface is to get to the place where there is clarity on what it is that the user wants to build, and then the system is able to generate a .concrete file structure.
The user should then be instructed into how to place this .concrete file structure into their IDE, Cursor or otherwise, so they can begin coding.
