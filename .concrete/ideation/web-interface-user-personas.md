- Finds it difficult to track progress across multiple projects

**Scenario:**
Alex is starting a new client project and wants to use Concrete to establish a solid foundation. They need a quick way to generate a .concrete structure that fits a React/Node.js project with authentication requirements. Alex prefers a visual approach to seeing how the project will be structured before diving into code.

**Key Needs:**
- Quick template selection
- Visual preview of structure
- Easy export to GitHub
- Minimal setup time

## Persona 2: Team Lead

- Advocates for best practices and standards

**Goals:**
- Establish consistent standards across team projects
- Improve documentation and knowledge sharing
- Reduce onboarding time for new team members
- Create scalable project structures that grow with the team

**Pain Points:**
- Team members follow inconsistent practices
- Documentation quickly becomes outdated
- New team members take weeks to understand project structure
- Difficult to maintain alignment between business goals and technical implementation

**Scenario:**
Maya's team is starting a new product initiative and she wants to use Concrete to establish a foundation that all team members can follow. She needs to collaborate with product managers to ensure the technical structure aligns with product requirements, then share the resulting .concrete structure with her team.

**Key Needs:**
- Collaborative features
- Ability to customize templates in detail
- Export options for team sharing
- Integration with existing tools (GitHub, Jira)

## Persona 3: Product Manager

### Carlos - Product Manager

**Demographics:**
- 31 years old
- 4 years as a product manager, former designer
- Works at a mid-size SaaS company
- Located in Austin, Texas

**Technical Background:**

- Familiar with design tools and product management software
- Limited experience with development environments

**Goals:**
- Better communicate product vision to development team
- Understand technical constraints and possibilities
- Maintain alignment between business goals and implementation
- Reduce back-and-forth with developers on requirements

**Pain Points:**
- Difficulty translating product requirements into technical structure
- Limited visibility into development process
- Communication gaps with technical team members
- Struggles to understand implications of technical decisions

**Scenario:**
Carlos has a clear vision for a new feature but needs help structuring it in a way developers can implement efficiently. He wants to use Concrete to articulate his vision and generate a structure that developers can use as a starting point, without needing to write any code himself.

**Key Needs:**
- Non-technical, conversational interface
- Visual representations of structure
- Simple export options
- Educational elements that explain technical concepts

## Persona 4: Designer-Developer Hybrid

### Priya - UX Engineer

**Demographics:**
- 26 years old
- 3 years of professional experience
- Works at a design-focused agency
- Located in Singapore

**Technical Background:**
- Strong in HTML, CSS, and frontend JavaScript
- Expert in design systems and component libraries
- Uses Figma, VS Code, and various design tools
- Growing experience with React and modern frameworks

**Goals:**
- Bridge the gap between design and development
- Create consistent component structures
- Establish patterns that both designers and developers understand
- Prototype quickly while maintaining quality

**Pain Points:**
- Design systems often don't align with code structure
- Difficulty maintaining consistency between design and implementation
- Struggles to communicate technical constraints to design team
- Needs to frequently switch between design and development mindsets

**Scenario:**
Priya is establishing a new design system that needs to be implemented in code. She wants to use Concrete to create a structure that organizes components logically and includes both design documentation and implementation guidelines. She needs to share this with both designers and developers.

**Key Needs:**
- Visual component organization
- Integration with design tools
- Structure that accommodates both code and design assets
- Collaborative features for cross-functional teams

## Persona 5: AI Enthusiast

### Jordan - AI-Augmented Developer

**Demographics:**
- 24 years old
- 2 years of professional experience
- Works at a tech startup
- Located in San Francisco, California

**Technical Background:**
- Moderate coding skills across several languages
- Heavy user of AI coding assistants
- Familiar with prompt engineering
- Comfortable with modern development workflows

**Goals:**
- Maximize productivity through AI tools
- Create systems that work well with AI assistants
- Learn and improve coding skills alongside AI
- Build projects that would be beyond their current skill level alone

**Pain Points:**
- AI tools often lose context or misunderstand project structure
- Difficulty maintaining consistency in AI-generated code
- Struggles to keep AI aligned with project vision
- Needs better ways to guide AI without writing perfect prompts

**Scenario:**
Jordan is starting a personal project and wants to use AI tools extensively in development. They need Concrete to create a structure that AI assistants can easily understand and follow, with clear guidelines that keep the AI aligned with their vision throughout the development process.

**Key Needs:**
- AI-friendly structure generation
- Clear documentation that works well with AI assistants
- Ability to refine and adjust as the project evolves
- Educational components that improve their own understanding

## Implications for Design
