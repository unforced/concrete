## Current Status

âœ… Completed: Milestone 0 - Project Setup
âœ… Completed: Milestone 1 - Create Base Concrete
âœ… Completed: Milestone 2 - Create Vite-Supabase Concrete
âœ… Created guide files for all milestones
âœ… Simplified repository structure
âœ… Project complete with core functionality
âœ… Completed: Milestone 3 - Create Adaptive Concrete
âœ… Simplified file structure by combining README.md and system-prompt.md
ðŸ”„ In Progress: Milestone 4 - Web Interface Development (Design Phase Completed, Implementation Next)

## Next Steps

1. ~~Update the other concrete templates (base, vite-supabase, adaptive) to use the combined README.md approach~~ âœ…
2. ~~Test the updated templates to ensure they work correctly~~ âœ…
3. Consider adding more specialized concrete templates in the future
4. Document usage examples and best practices
5. Begin implementation of web interface based on design documents:
   - Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
   - Implement basic layout and navigation
   - Create chat interface components
   - Set up OpenAI API integration

## Recent Updates

- Reorganized repository structure, moving templates to concrete-libs folder
- Created detailed design documents for web interface:
  - web-interface-design-concepts.md: UX principles, visual design, and wireframes
  - web-interface-user-personas.md: Detailed user personas and design implications
  - web-interface-conversation-flow.md: Chatbot conversation patterns and scripts
- Created conversation summary for web interface design phase (.concrete/conversations/2024-05-15-web-interface-design-phase.md)
