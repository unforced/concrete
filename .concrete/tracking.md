## Current Status

✅ Completed: Milestone 0 - Project Setup
✅ Completed: Milestone 1 - Create Base Concrete
✅ Completed: Milestone 2 - Create Vite-Supabase Concrete
✅ Created guide files for all milestones
✅ Simplified repository structure
✅ Project complete with core functionality
✅ Completed: Milestone 3 - Create Adaptive Concrete
✅ Simplified file structure by combining README.md and system-prompt.md

## Next Steps

1. Update the other concrete templates (base, vite-supabase, adaptive) to use the combined README.md approach
2. Test the updated templates to ensure they work correctly
3. Consider adding more specialized concrete templates in the future
4. Document usage examples and best practices
