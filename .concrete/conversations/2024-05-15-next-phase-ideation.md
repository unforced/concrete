   - Conversational AI to guide vision refinement
   - Voice interface capabilities
   - Real-time feedback and summarization

2. **Visualization Components**
   - Mind-mapping tools
   - Real-time preview of .concrete structure
   - Interactive diagrams for system architecture

3. **Multi-modal Input Methods**
   - Sketch-to-structure conversion
   - Existing project file analysis
   - Template gallery with customization

4. **Export & Integration Options**
   - One-click export as zip
