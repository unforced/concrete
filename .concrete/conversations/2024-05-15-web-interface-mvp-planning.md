**Date:** May 15, 2024

## Summary

This conversation focused on developing a detailed implementation plan for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Concrete web interface. We prioritized features, outlined a technical implementation strategy, and created a week-by-week development plan.

## Key Points Discussed

1. **Feature Prioritization**
   - Identified core features for Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): chatbot interface, visualization, and basic export
   - Planned enhanced features for Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): expanded input methods, user management, and GitHub integration
   - Deferred advanced features like voice interface and collaborative editing to post-MVP

2. **Technical Implementation**
   - Selected technology stack: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, OpenAI API

4. **Testing and Metrics**
   - Developed a comprehensive testing strategy including unit, integration, and user testing
   - Identified key metrics for measuring success across usability, technical, and business dimensions
   - Planned for continuous improvement based on user feedback

## Outcomes

- Created a detailed implementation plan document (.concrete/ideation/web-interface-mvp-plan.md)
