# Conversation: Web Interface Design Phase

**Date:** May 15, 2024

## Summary

This conversation focused on the design phase of the Concrete web interface development. We reorganized the repository structure and created detailed design documents for the web interface, including user experience concepts, user personas, and conversation flow design.

## Key Points Discussed

1. **Repository Reorganization**
   - Moved existing templates (adaptive, base, vite-supabase) into a new concrete-libs folder
   - Prepared the repository for web interface development

2. **Design Concepts**
   - Established user experience principles: guided yet flexible, progressive disclosure, real-time feedback
   - Created visual design concepts including color palette, typography, and layout options
   - Designed wireframe concepts for key screens
   - Outlined UI component concepts for chat, visualization, input, and export interfaces

3. **User Personas**
   - Developed five detailed personas representing different user types:
     - Solo Developer (Alex): Needs quick setup and visual preview
     - Team Lead (Maya): Needs collaboration and integration with existing tools
     - Product Manager (Carlos): Needs non-technical interface and visual representations
     - Designer-Developer Hybrid (Priya): Needs bridge between design and development
     - AI Enthusiast (Jordan): Needs AI-friendly structure and guidance

4. **Conversation Flow**
   - Designed detailed conversation patterns for the chatbot interface
   - Created scripts for initial engagement, project vision exploration, and adaptive follow-ups
   - Developed decision trees for project type and technical stack determination
   - Outlined recovery patterns for handling vague answers or confusion
   - Created prompt templates for vision extraction and structure generation

## Outcomes

- Created three detailed ideation documents:
  - web-interface-design-concepts.md: UX principles, visual design, and wireframes
  - web-interface-user-personas.md: Detailed user personas and design implications
  - web-interface-conversation-flow.md: Chatbot conversation patterns and scripts

- Established a clear foundation for the implementation phase
- Identified key design principles that will guide development

## Next Steps

- Create high-fidelity wireframes for key screens
- Develop a visual design system (colors, typography, components)
- Begin implementation of the core chat interface
- Set up the Next.js project with the chosen technology stack
