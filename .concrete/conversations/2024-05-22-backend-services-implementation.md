# Conversation: Backend Services and Export Implementation

Date: May 22, 2024

## Summary

This conversation focused on implementing backend services for the Concrete web interface and adding export functionality. We created API routes for AI processing and file export, and developed a user interface for exporting the .concrete structure in different formats.

## Key Points

1. **Backend API Routes**
   - Created an AI generation API route for processing user prompts
   - Implemented an export API route for converting structures to different formats
   - Added a download API route for serving exported files

2. **Export Functionality**
   - Developed an export dialog component with multiple format options
   - Added support for JSON, ZIP, and GitHub repository exports
   - Integrated the export UI with the backend API

3. **Structure Viewer Enhancements**
   - Updated the structure viewer to include export functionality
   - Improved the tree view component with better selection handling
   - Enhanced the file/directory display with more details

4. **Authentication Integration**
   - Configured the API routes to work with the authentication system
   - Ensured protected routes are properly secured

## Next Steps

1. Add collaborative features for team projects
2. Create unit and integration tests
3. Implement user settings and preferences
4. Add analytics for usage tracking

## Action Items

- [ ] Implement real-time collaboration using WebSockets
- [ ] Create unit tests for components and API routes
- [ ] Add user settings page
- [ ] Set up analytics for tracking usage
