# Conversation: Process Improvements

**Date:** May 15, 2024

## Summary

This conversation focused on implementing process improvements to the Concrete documentation structure. We refined the organization of files and folders to make the system more intuitive and maintainable.

## Key Points Discussed

1. **Ideation Folder Purpose**
   - Recognized that the ideation folder has evolved to be a collaborative space for both user and AI thoughts
   - Formalized this approach in the documentation

2. **Documentation Structure Changes**
   - Renamed `.concrete/README.md` to `.concrete/system.md` to avoid confusion with the root README.md
   - Eliminated the separate tracking.md file, moving tracking into individual milestone files
   - Renamed the guides folder to milestones to better reflect its purpose
   - Updated milestone files to include their own tracking and relevant resources

3. **Linking Strategy**
   - Moved from linking all conversations and ideation documents in the system.md file
   - Implemented a more focused approach where each milestone links only to its relevant resources
   - Reduced the need to frequently update the system.md file

4. **System.md Updates**
   - Limited updates to the system.md file to milestone transitions and major architectural decisions
   - Simplified the overall documentation maintenance process

## Outcomes

- Created a new `.concrete/system.md` file with updated guidelines
- Created a new `.concrete/milestones` directory to replace guides
- Updated the web interface development milestone file with the new format
- Established clearer guidelines for documentation maintenance

## Next Steps

- Continue with the implementation of the web interface based on the updated structure
- Begin with setting up the Next.js project as outlined in the milestone file
