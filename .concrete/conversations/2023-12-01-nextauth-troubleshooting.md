# NextAuth Troubleshooting

**Date**: December 1, 2023
**Participants**: User, AI Assistant

## Summary

This conversation focused on troubleshooting issues with NextAuth.js configuration in the web interface project. The user reported errors related to authentication, including a `ClientFetchError` with the message "Unexpected token '<', '<!DOCTYPE '... is not valid JSON" and a module resolution error "Cannot find module '../chunks/ssr/[turbopack]_runtime.js'".

## Key Points

1. **Error Identification**:
   - The user encountered a `ClientFetchError` when trying to authenticate
   - There was also a module resolution error related to Turbopack and Next.js

2. **Configuration Issues**:
   - The providers array in `auth.ts` had type errors due to conditional inclusion of OAuth providers
   - Environment variables were not properly set up for NextAuth

3. **Solutions Implemented**:
   - Fixed the providers array in `auth.ts` to properly handle conditional OAuth providers
   - Created a `.env.local` file with necessary NextAuth environment variables
   - Added a fallback secret key for development
   - Rebuilt the application to verify the fixes

4. **Results**:
   - The build process completed successfully without errors
   - The type errors in the auth configuration were resolved
   - The environment variables were properly set up for NextAuth

## Action Items

1. Complete the AI integration for the chat interface
2. Implement the export functionality
3. Test the authentication flow with the updated configuration
4. Consider adding more robust error handling for authentication failures

## Code Changes

The main changes were made to the `auth.ts` file to fix the providers array:

```typescript
providers: [
  CredentialsProvider({
    // ... existing configuration
  }),
  // Only add GitHub provider if credentials are available
  ...(process.env.GITHUB_ID && process.env.GITHUB_SECRET
    ? [
        GithubProvider({
          clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
          clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET,
        })
      ]
    : []),
  // Only add Google provider if credentials are available
  ...(process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID && process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
    ? [
        GoogleProvider({
          clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
          clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
        })
      ]
    : []),
],
```

Additionally, a `.env.local` file was created with the necessary environment variables:

```
# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-for-development

# OAuth Providers (add your own credentials when ready)
# GITHUB_ID=
# GITHUB_SECRET=
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```
