# Conversation: Authentication Implementation

Date: May 21, 2024

## Summary

This conversation focused on implementing authentication for the Concrete web interface using NextAuth.js. We set up the authentication system with multiple providers and created the necessary pages and components for user authentication.

## Key Points

1. **NextAuth.js Setup**
   - Installed NextAuth.js package
   - Configured authentication providers (GitHub, Google, and Credentials)
   - Set up environment variables for authentication

2. **Authentication Pages**
   - Created a sign-in page with email/password and social login options
   - Implemented a sign-out confirmation page
   - Added an error page to handle authentication errors

3. **Authentication Components**
   - Developed an AuthProvider component to wrap the application
   - Created an AuthGuard component to protect routes
   - Implemented a UserButton component for the header

4. **Integration with Layout**
   - Updated the root layout to include the AuthProvider and AuthGuard
   - Modified the Header component to use the UserButton
   - Updated the home page to check authentication status

## Next Steps

1. Connect to backend services for AI processing
2. Implement export functionality for .concrete structures
3. Add collaborative features for team projects
4. Create unit and integration tests

## Action Items

- [ ] Set up backend API routes for AI processing
- [ ] Implement export functionality
- [ ] Add collaborative features
- [ ] Create tests for authentication flow
